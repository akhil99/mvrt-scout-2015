###Usage
For each alliance, you need one device running super scout, as well as 3 devices running the regular scouting app. The super scout needs to be connected to the internet, however the 3 scouts only need a bluetooth connection. To connect, first pair the devices through the device's system settings. Paired devices will then show up in the Bluetooth Settings page of the scouting app, from where you can connect to the super scout device. To access the Bluetooth Setting page, swipe left or click on the icon at the top-left of the app to open the nav drawer.
